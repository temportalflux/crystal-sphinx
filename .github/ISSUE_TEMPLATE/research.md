Deliverables:
- Create a notes document in the wiki space
- Determine outcomes (more research tickets, actionable features, etc)

Questions to be answered:
- What outcomes/techniques are desirable for this project? Any that are just not desirable for the goals of this project?
- Are any of these outcomes out of scope? If so, is it out of scope in the short term (i.e. lower priority) or long term (i.e. aspirational but for some indeterminate future).
